# Warehouse-Tool
Curio Internship: 6 februari t/m 7 juli.
***
### Usage:
Console-based tool that can be used through the commandline, it can load a JSON setting file that sends the data to the API, 
then sets up a test-warehouse and can be used to save alternate settings that were changed later on.

The API used here was specifically created for the company where my intership was. I used Docker to develop and test the API/app.
